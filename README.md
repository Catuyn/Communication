Communication Activity!

Description:
- Everyone in the class has been given 2-3 bits of information
- Your task is to work together as a class to combine every bit and recover an ASCII encoded hidden message
- The data was given in alphabetical order by your github id's
- Sorting was performed after converting ids to lower case
- If anyone is missing, you can create a pull request adding their name to "missing.txt"
- If there are _enough_ comments confirming an absence (A simple "+1" will suffice) their bits will be revealed
- Once the solution has been found, create a pull request adding the text to "answer.txt"

Grading:
- If there is a pull request with the correct answer in "answer.txt" before the end of lecture, everyone except the students listed in "missing.txt" will receive credit
- If there is not a pull request with the correct answer in "answer.txt" no one will receive credit

Hints:
- There are 130 students who have been sent data
